Implementation of convolutional neural networks with and without Tensor Flow

 - The codes in this repository were written in an effort to implement and explore various features of convolutional neural networks on kaggle. The skeleton code could be found in Kaggle Computer Vision code.
 
 - The main libraries used were Numpy and Tensorflow
